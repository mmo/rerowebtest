# RERO ILS: open source integrated library system

RERO ILS is an open source integrated library system (ILS) developed by RERO in collaboration with the Catholic University of Louvain (UCLouvain). This is a category of software used to manage the day-to-day operations of a library (document acquisitions, lending, cataloguing, searching) and to provide a public interface for users. RERO ILS is intended to enable the management of a library network, but is also suitable for independent libraries.

From a technical point of view, RERO ILS is based on the Invenio framework developed at CERN.

A demonstration system is publicly available at the following address: [ils.test.rero.ch](https://ils.test.rero.ch).
